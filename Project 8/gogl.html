        	<p>The Google story began in 1995 at Stanford University. Larry Page was considering enrolling at Stanford University, and Sergey Brin was a student at <br>the same university, and he was tasked with taking Larry on a tour of the college.<br>Some say that they did not agree on almost any topic during their first meeting, but the following year, they formed a partnership. Working from their dorm room, we were able to design a search engine that uses links to determine the importance of individual pages on the World Wide Web. They called that search engine Backrub.<br>Soon after, they renamed Backrub to Google. The new name was a mathematical expression forthe number 1 followed by 100 zeros, and reflected Larry and Sergey's endeavor to "organize information available in the world and facilitate access to and use of it globally." A few years later, </p>

In August 1998, Sun's founding partner Andy Biktolsheim wrote a check for $ 100,000 to Larry and Sergey and Google was officially incorporated. With the investment, the newly formed team improved the company's position, moving from working in college residences to setting up the company's first office: a garage in the California suburb of Menlo Barb, once owned by Susan Wojcicki (who was Employee Number 16 and now chief executive. For YouTube). The office is equipped with large computers, a ping pong table and a light blue carpet, and the atmosphere is set to work long hours from early morning until late at night. The tradition of using color across the colorful Google offices still exists today 
           Even in the company's beginnings, the process was unconventional: from the first Google server (made of LEGO) to the first logo “ 1998 ” that included a stick to inform site visitors that

           <p>all employees were absent from work to participate in the Burning Man Festival. Then came the rules of “Don't be evil” and “ Ten facts that we know are true ” to reflect the unconventional spirit of work that we deliberately adhere to. In the years that followed, the company has expanded rapidly - has been hiring engineers and building sales team and the acquisition of the first dog in the company, called "Joschka". Google became larger than the garage space, and it was finally relocated to its current headquarters (also known as "The Googleplex") in Mountain View, California. The desire to work differently has always been the main driver behind this move that included "Yoshka" Also.

            The relentless search for the best answers remains at the core of everything we do. Today, with more than 60,000 employees in 50 different countries, Google provides hundreds of products to thousands of millions of users around the world, such as YouTube, Android Gmail, and of course, Google Search. It is true that we no longer use servers made of Lego pieces and that we have received more dogs in the company, the passion for designing technological products for everyone continues to accompany us, from the time we were in the dorm, then in the garage, and until this day.
