            Company History. Apple Computers, Inc. was founded on April 1, 1976, by college dropouts Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who brought to the new company a vision of changing the way people viewed computers. Jobs and Wozniak wanted to make computers small enough for people to have them in their homes or offices.

            <h2>CO-Founders</h2>
            <p>
                Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, co-founders of Apple, in 1977. Before Steve Jobs was the serious, turtleneck-wearing CEO and co-founder of Apple, he was a young guy who would goof off, scheme elaborate pranks and go to concerts with friends. ... They founded Apple Computers, Inc. in 1976, when Jobs was 21 and Wozniak was 26.
                Wozniak said the antics stopped after Apple received its first big investment, a guaranteed bank loan of $250,000 from Mike Markkula in 1977 (the equivalent of over $1.1 million), and the company started to take off.
